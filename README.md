# Game Development Assignment - Enhancing a Pygame Project

## Overview

This assignment involves downloading and enhancing an existing Pygame-based project. The task is to build upon the provided code by adding new functionalities, including images, sound effects, and other improvements to make the game more interactive and polished.

### Assignment Goals:
- Download the provided Pygame code from the GitHub repository.
- Enhance the project by adding the following elements:
  - **Images**: Replace basic shapes with images for the player and obstacles.
  - **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for actions like jumping, colliding, and game-over.
  - **Background Music**: Add looping background music to enhance the gaming experience.
  

### Submission Requirements:
1. **Code Modifications**: Submit the enhanced code as a GitHub repository.
2. **Documentation**: Provide clear comments in the code and update the README to explain the changes made.
3. **Game Assets**: Include all images, sound effects, and music files in the repository or provide links to where they can be downloaded from.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. **Setup and Download**
   - Download the provided repository from GitHub and open the project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., `pygame`) using the terminal.

### 2. **Enhance the Game**

#### **A. Adding Images (Sprites)**
   - Replace basic player and obstacle shapes with images.
   - Add images for backgrounds, player characters, and any other visual elements.
   - Consider using assets from OpenGameArt.org, Itch.io, or Kenney.nl.

#### **B. Adding Sound Effects**
   - Add sound effects for key events such as:
     - Jumping
     - Colliding with obstacles
     - Scoring a point
   - You can use sound assets from sites like freesound.org or Zapsplat.com.


#### **C. Adding Background Music**
   - Choose or create a background music track and integrate it into the game.
   - The music should loop indefinitely during gameplay.


### 3. **Testing**
   - Test the game to ensure all added features work correctly (e.g., image load, sound plays, score updates).
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

## Submission Guidelines

### 1. **Code Submission**
   - Create a public GitHub repository using your own account and add the files and folders associated with the game.
   - Ensure the code is well-commented and easy to understand.

### 2. **README File Update**
   - Update the README file with details about:
     - The changes made to the project (images, sound, new features, etc.).
     - Instructions on how to run the game (e.g., "Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the `game.py` file").
   - Include links to any external assets used (images, sound, music) and credit the creators.

### 3. **Assets**
   - Include all the game assets (images, sounds, music) in the repository as a folder.
   - Ensure the assets are correctly named and easy to locate in the project directory.
